# lambda-tor-layer

AWS Lambda introduces a new feautre [Layer](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-use-any-programming-language-and-share-common-components/) that helps developers split common components into standalone package. 

We use this feature to build a layer for tor proxy. It can be re-used by other projects.
